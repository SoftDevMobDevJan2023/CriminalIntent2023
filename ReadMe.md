App: Criminal Intent
======================
***Reference***: BNR book, Chapter 9

***CriminalIntent*** records the details of "office crimes" â€“ things like leaving dirty dishes in the break room sink or walking away
from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.

With CriminalIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You
can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook,
or another app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of
resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.

CriminalIntent is a complex app that will take 11 chapters to complete. It will have a list-detail
interface: The main screen will display a list of recorded crimes, and users will be able to add new
crimes or select an existing crime to view and edit its details (Figure 8.1)

# Chapter 12

***Room*** (database access API):
- Version 2.4.2 mentioned in BNR book does not work properly (Error with "suspend" use for `CrimeDAO.getCrimes`).
  - Change to version "2.4.3" solved this

***CrimeDAO.getCrimes()***:
```
interface CrimeDao {
  @Query("SELECT * FROM crime")
  // this does not work!!:
  // suspend fun getCrimes(): List<Crime>
  fun getCrimes(): Flow<List<Crime>>

  @Query("SELECT * FROM crime WHERE id=(:id)")
  suspend fun getCrime(id: UUID): Crime
}
```

# Chapter 13

## Scope
In this chapter, you will get the list and the detail parts of CriminalIntent
working together. Using the Navigation Jetpack library, you will define the
screens your users will be able to see and how your users can move
between them.

When a user presses an item in the list of crimes, the Navigation library will
swap out CrimeListFragment with a new instance of
CrimeDetailFragment displaying the details for the crime that was
pressed
